# Rock Paper Scissors

Only two users can play at the same time.  Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make
their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other. Also there is chat functionality
players can chat each other, and get information about they quit or not.
